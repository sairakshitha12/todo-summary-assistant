Todo Summary Assistant:
Project Description
Todo Summary Assistant is a full-stack application that allows users to input their daily tasks and automatically generate meaningful summaries using a Large Language Model (LLM) like Cohere or OpenAI. The summarized tasks are then posted to a Slack channel via Slack Incoming Webhooks, helping teams stay aligned.
Setup Instructions:
Prerequisites:
Node.js installed on your machine

npm or yarn package manager

Accounts and API keys for:

Cohere or OpenAI (for LLM access)

Slack (to create an Incoming Webhook)

Supabase or Firebase (optional, for backend/database hosting)
Steps:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-summary-assistant.git
cd todo-summary-assistant
Install dependencies

For backend:
cd backend
npm install

For frontend:
cd ../frontend
npm install
Configure environment variables

Create a .env file in the root of your backend folder (based on .env.example) and add your API keys and URLs:

env

SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url_here
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
Start the backend server

npm start
Start the frontend app

npm start
Open your browser

Visit http://localhost:3000 (or the port your frontend runs on) and start adding your to-do items!

Slack and LLM Setup Guidance
Slack Incoming Webhook Setup
Go to your Slack workspace.

Navigate to Apps and search for Incoming Webhooks.

Add a new webhook to the desired channel.

Copy the webhook URL and add it to your .env file as SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL.

LLM API Setup (Cohere or OpenAI)
Cohere

Create a Cohere account at cohere.ai.

Generate your API key from the dashboard.

Add the key to your .env as COHERE_API_KEY.

Use the "command" model or other models you have access to.

OpenAI

Create an account on OpenAI.

Generate an API key.

Add it to .env as OPENAI_API_KEY.

Adjust your backend code accordingly to call OpenAI APIs.

Design / Architecture Decisions
Frontend with React:
Chosen for its component-based architecture and ease of building interactive UIs for inputting to-do items.

Backend with Node.js & Express:
Handles API requests from the frontend, communicates with the LLM API for summarization, and posts summaries to Slack.

LLM Integration:
Cohere or OpenAI APIs provide natural language understanding and generation capabilities for meaningful to-do list summaries.

Slack Integration:
Slack Incoming Webhooks allow seamless posting of summaries to team channels for improved communication.

Environment Variables:
Sensitive information like API keys and webhook URLs are stored in .env files, and .env.example is provided for reference without exposing secrets.

Optional Database (Supabase/Firebase):
Can be used to persist to-do items and user data for future enhancements like authentication and history tracking.
